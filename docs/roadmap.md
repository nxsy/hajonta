# Roadmap

Mostly a list of things to try implement in demos/stand-alone apps for now.

## Done (at least first pass)

### Demos

* Basic rainbow quad (“Hello World” for OpenGL)
* Unified controller/keyboard input
* Load bitmap, render to OpenGL
* Render text to bitmap from font bitmap
* Basic linear algebra vector/matrix math, calculate normals, ...
* Basic line/line 2d collision detection
* MVP matrices
* Texture loading
* Fireworks basic physics demo

### Model Editor

* .obj/.mtl file reading
* Basic Phong shading
* Normal maps
* Emission maps
* Ambient Occlusion maps (pre-computed, texture)
* ui2d shader for text, windows, &c.
* Basic skybox
* Specular material
* Directional light
* Compressed texture loading (DDS, DXT)
* Multiple lights
* Export to asset structure
* Camera control

## To do (short-term)

### Demos

* Full scene from editor asset export

### Model Editor

* “Resize” to common (1 = 1m) format
* Spotlight
* Shadows
* Ambient light factor control
* Better skybox
* FXAA
* HDR

## Ideas for later
